      <p>The objective of this project is to build a robust and scalable collaborative document editor that supports real-time editing and role-based access.</p>
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable real-time collaboration</li>
        <li>Support for multiple user roles (Editor, Reviewer, Viewer, Admin)</li>
        <li>Commenting and document history</li>
        <li>Offline support and autosave</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This overview serves as a foundational document to align the team and stakeholders on the project’s direction and expectations.</p>
      <p>Notes from our latest team meeting.</p>
      <p>Meeting notes are a concise yet comprehensive record of the discussions, decisions, and action items from a meeting.</p>
      <p>They serve as an official reference, capturing key points such as the meeting’s purpose, attendees, topics covered, and responsibilities assigned. Well-structured meeting notes help ensure that all participants have a clear understanding of what was discussed and agreed upon, while also providing a point of reference for those who could not attend.</p>
      <p>They are crucial for tracking progress on tasks, maintaining accountability, and avoiding miscommunication, making them an essential tool for effective collaboration and project management.</p>
      <h3>Action Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Finalize wireframes by August 5</li>
        <li>Set up backend authentication module</li>
        <li>Assign roles to all registered users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This development plan outlines the key phases and milestones for the upcoming release cycle.</p>
      <h3>Phases:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1 – Setup:</strong> Project scaffolding, environment setup, and dependency installation.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2 – Core Features:</strong> Implement document editing, real-time presence, and comments.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3 – Access Control:</strong> Add role-based permissions and admin tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4 – Polish & Test:</strong> UI improvements, bug fixes, and QA testing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Following this roadmap will help ensure smooth execution and timely delivery.</p>
